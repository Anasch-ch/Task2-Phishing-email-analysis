##1. Email Sample Overview
Source: phishing email sample for educational purposes.(stimulated from phishtank)

Date Received: [03-05-2020]

Purpose: To trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link by impersonating a bank alert.

## 2. Sender’s Email Address Analysis
From: alert@secure-bank.com

Analysis:

At first glance, the email address seems legitimate, mimicking a bank’s alert system.

However, most real banks have specific, well-known official domains (e.g., securebank.com or bankname.com).

The hyphen (-) in secure-bank.com can be a subtle difference used to deceive users (typosquatting).

Spoofed email addresses are common in phishing to trick users into trusting the sender.

##3. Email Header Analysis (Hypothetical)
Tools Used: Online email header analyzer (e.g., MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer)

Findings:

SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Fails because the sending IP is not authorized to send mail for secure-bank.com.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Missing or invalid signature, indicating the email may have been forged.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication): Policy is not aligned or is set to reject, but the email bypassed these controls, raising suspicion.

Received Headers: The email was relayed through suspicious IP addresses unrelated to the legitimate bank’s mail servers.

These inconsistencies in the header confirm the sender’s address is likely spoofed or the message is forged.


##4. Suspicious Links and Attachments
Link Displayed: https://secure-bank.com (appears trustworthy)

Actual Link: https://verify-account-login.com (a completely different domain)

Risk:

This is a classic phishing technique called URL spoofing or link masking.

Hovering over the link reveals the real destination, which is designed to look like a login page to steal credentials.

Attachments: None in this example, but phishing emails often include malicious attachments like .exe, .scr, .zip which may install malware.

## 5. Language and Tone Analysis
Urgency and Threats:

Phrases like “Your bank account will be locked!” and “Failure to verify within 24 hours” pressure recipients to act quickly without thinking.

This psychological manipulation induces panic, increasing the likelihood that the victim will click the malicious link.

Politeness and Formality:

The email attempts to sound professional and polite, closing with “Thank you for your prompt attention” and “Sincerely, Secure Bank Security Team.”

This adds a false sense of trustworthiness.


## 6. URL Mismatches
The URL visible to the user (secure-bank.com) is different from the real URL (verify-account-login.com).

This mismatch is one of the strongest phishing indicators.

If a user clicks the link, they could be taken to a fake login page designed to steal credentials.

## 7. Spelling and Grammar Errors
In this example, spelling and grammar are mostly correct, showing a higher level of sophistication.

Some phishing emails have obvious mistakes, but many modern phishing attempts are professionally written.


##8. Summary of Phishing Characteristics
The email exhibits multiple phishing indicators:

Spoofed and deceptive sender address.

Email header discrepancies (SPF/DKIM failures).

Mismatched and suspicious URLs designed to steal login credentials.

Use of urgent and threatening language to coerce immediate action.

These elements combined make the email a high-risk phishing attempt aimed at compromising user security.
